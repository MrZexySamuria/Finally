# IRC Server Conclusion
So, the conclusion from IRC server is that after obtaining the laptop from the lad I proceeded to open up and place in a hard drive for it need one.
  Then from there I decided to boot up the computer to see if it had windows on it it did not so I had to run a bun to on it. 
  Then from there I had to receive help several times 4 hours unclear on and had a hard time remembering how to upload and download information on a bun to or Linux. 
  After downloading the unreal IRC I soon ran into several problems but after poking around in the Linux I found out where a had to open and will fall as a had to open and run.
  Sadly though I was unable to finish my RC server due to the fact that I was unable to successfully set it up to to the fact that I was unclear that I was setting up an IRC from scratch.
  Are least it seemed that way for me I kept running into problem after problem and was unable to do anything. 
  I manage to get back to the same exact spot each time but I was unclear of where to go from there for I did not know what else to do.
  In retrospect if I was to do this project again I would say do more research and tried to find and IRC server that allows one to more less upload the program and immediately run the server and set of trying to set 1 up from the beginning. 
  That's a list my 2 cents that I got out of this project it was quite enlightening and I did enjoy the history behind it.
