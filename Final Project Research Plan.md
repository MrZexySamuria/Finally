# Final Project Research Plan
For my final project I'll be doing data recovery. Data recovery is the action of recovering information from a hard drive or memory source in the hopes to read or process the information for one's own potion will use. Let's say I have a damaged hard drive or have an old computer then I want to pull information off of it using a the FTK to extract the data from the hard drive.
I can do so for the informationis still there. Everything that I've found so far though internet page and descriptions are that to use the data recovery program are only free trials of data recovery. Nothing to use for extended time. 
The more I look into it the more interested it seemed but at the very same time the more deterred I field for I feel like I'm in a boat with a pretty big hole. But the more and more I found I found out that you can do data recovery on your own but the problem is the need for special items. Such as a power brick for the said memory unit a USB adapter to the memory unit so you be able to read it on your computer. 
In the end the maximum cost this project would be anywhere from 20 to $30. This is for the power brick and the USB adapter. Sadly, now I'm having hard time finding much information on the subject I want to do. I hope I find something more in the days to come.
