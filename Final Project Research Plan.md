# Final Project Research Plan
For my final project I'll be doing data recovery. Data recovery is the action of recovering information from a hard drive or memory source and the hopes to read or process the information for one's own potion will use. This means let's say I have a damaged hard drive or have an old computer then I wanna pull information off of I will use a or less a to kit to extract the data from the hard drive. Everything that I've found so far though involves page descriptions and a free trials of data recovery. 
The more look into it the more intrested I seen but at the very same time the more deterred I field for I feel like I'm in a boat with a pretty big hole. But the more and more I found I found out that you can do data recovery on your own but the problem is the need for special items. Such as a power brick for the said memory unit a USB adapter to the memory unit so you be able to read it on your computer. 
In the end the maximum cost this project would be anywhere from 20 to $30. This is for the power brick and the USB adapter. Sadly now I'm having hard time finding much information on the subject I want to do. I hope I find something more in the days to come.
