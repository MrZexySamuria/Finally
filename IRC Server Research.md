# IRC Server Research
So, after poking around on that and up some for some time I found that the IRC server was a very basic form of the Internet.
  But as I found out that was only in the beginning it is now considered a chat room on the Internet. But that is all history I will be talking about what I hope to accomplish by setting up my IRC server.
 In turn I hope to set up my RIC server and be able to communicate between 2 computers effectively with no miscommunication between those who are lost text. I will need a least a computer to run this server I was thinking a laptop for it would be the best thing for it is everything I need in one. 
Then from there I will install and I receive server program. The Iris I program is from unreal and I hope top load it to the computer and have it work effectively. The problems I see about setting up my Iris E server is that higher will not be able to run it affectively for I do not have much know how or knowledge in what I am doing. But I can't wait to see what happens.
Goals: Get a laptop, load up a windows program. Then download the Unreal IRC server and run the program. Then go from there.
